# MTEL-Answer-Checker
A simple GUI to check the answers on the middle school math MTEL practice test.

The point of this is that its hard to look at the answer key without seeing the answers to future problems. 

Also, the answer key just shows the correct answers. So, you essentially have one attempt. This gui will only tell you if you are right or wrong, so you can keep going until you get it.

I also created a "hint" button for when you get the wrong answer. The hint button is the description of the correct solution without telling you what letter it is.
