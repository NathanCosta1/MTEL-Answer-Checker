# MTEL-Answer-Checker
A simple GUI to check the answers on the middle school math MTEL practice test.

The point of this is it provides a way to only check your answer to the question you are working on. It's hard to look at the answer key without seeing the answers to future problems. If you accidently see the answer to the next question then it is very easy to convince yourself you understand the correct answer if you already know what it is beforehand.

There are 85 problems in this practice set, so it is impractically to do them all in one sitting and then check your work all at once. I think it is more helpful to check as you go, because if you are confidenet something is right you may ingrain a bad habit until you finally check your work 2 weeks later and find out you were wrong.

Also, the answer key just shows the correct answers. So, you essentially have one attempt. This gui will only tell you if you are right or wrong, so you can keep going until you get it. 

I also created a "hint" button for when you get the wrong answer. The hint button is the description of the correct solution without telling you what letter it is.
